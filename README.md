I utilized 2 methods for the data cleaning, 
1. For method 1, I did cleaning for each csv file, and then appended them together
2. For method 2, I used list to hold the dataframes, and concated them together, and then did the data cleaning

Found out that, method 2 took much less processing time than method 1 (approximately 30% faster)
