# COVID_19-China-Analysis
I used pandas for the data cleaning of the Covid_19 datasets. 

Two methods are utilized:
1. For method 1, I did cleaning for each csv file, and then appended them together
2. For method 2, I used a list to hold the dataframes and concated them together, and then did the data cleaning to the combined dataframe

Found out that method 2 took much less processing time than method 1 (approximately 30% faster)
